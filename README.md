Synthcraft
==========

A world of synthetic possibility

Synthcraft is a forge mod for Minecraft that adds in synthetic or experimental materials.

A)Planned Materials
===================

Polymers: thermoplastics, styrene (for clear plastics), rubber ,resins,
epoxies, and vulkanized rubbers/plastics. 

Synthetic fibers: Kevlar, and rayon (others will be added soon)

Composites: Concrete, plywood, cardboard, Wattle and daub(bricks),Graphite, and numerous others.

Derived materials: Silicon, salt, and Lime; but others are bound to show up.

B)Crafting systems
==================

Synthcraft will feature three machines to extend the crafting experience of Minecraft

The Filtrator: In its most basic form sifts materials into other usable components
such as sand-> silicates which can then be smelted into silicon or combined
with other materials to yield more glass.

The Furnacinator: Converts metals and other materials into a liquid state
for further processing. However, due to platypus tampering slag is created 
as a byproduct.

The Mould Injector: Fills premade moulds with liquid materials for crafting
this will have a more profound effect in metalworking and tool creation.

C)Integration
=============

Synthcraft will work closely with the mod Arenacraft (which is currently in the works)

We will also be integrating full ore-dictionary support, standard configuration options
and the Liquid-API.

There are full plans to implement IndustrialCraft2 and Universal Electricity recipes
as well as machines (such as an electric arc furnace) and other things such as
the Alkaline Battery.

We will add in Buildcraft support as well: storage tanks for the liquified
materials, oil processing to polymers, extraction of oil etc.

D)Items, tools, and other knick-knacks
======================================
Plastic Tools: Plastic tools are a low-mid tier item (pre-iron), they are durable but
not very dense and therefore make somewhat poor tools.

Synthetic Tools: these are high end post diamond tools such as the Graphite tools
these are both resilient and able to tackle many ores.

The Plaxel: The "plastic Paxel" a relatively low tier item that can be used as either
a pick,axe,or shovel.

The Synth-army-knife: a "top tier item" that can be switched to perform many roles
and will share one bar for all functions. The synth-army-knife can be used as:
a Shovel, pickaxe, hoe, axe, flint and steel, bow (maybe), chisel, and sword.
I may add additional support (such as IC/BC wrenches for example)

Synthahol: a synthetic alcohol which can be used as a fuel or further refined for
other purposes.

Synthetic-Beautifiers: Using our advanced hyperreactive-sythaholic-inductionation
technology we are able to provide you with the best goggles emeralds can buy.

Night vision goggles: Tired of delving into caves, running out of torches and being the
target of creeper hazing becuase you just can't see down the hallway? Yeah us too,
so we made these.



E)World generation/other
========================

Synthcraft does not have any current world generation in mind
this is of course subject to change.

This will continue to get updated as the mod continues to grow
we are finding new synthetic materials and other gaps where we
would like to see increased gameplay.
